      <header><h3>About Me</h3></header>
      <p>I am a Computer Science student working hard towards my degree. While going to school full-time I have maintained a full-time
job and a career in the Army National Guard. I have also completed two NASA programs.
I love to work and am highly  motivated. Please check out my projects. I will continue to update this page as my skills improve.</p>

  <header><h3>Career</h3><header>
  <p>I currently work as a Mortgage Loan Assistant where I specialize in secondary market mortgages.  I have been with this company for over two years. During this time I have worked my way up from Customer Service into the Mortgage Division.
  It is a great company, and I have gotten to travel the state with them, however Finance is not what I am passionate about.  I have used what I have learned in my Computer Science classes to help stream line my work flow.</p>
    <p>I finished my intitial contract with the Army National Guard October 30, 2020. I enlisted in 2014 as a Combat Engineer and learned how to build explosives at Fort Leonard Wood.  It was a blast, to say the least.
    With the Army I have gotten to travel the United States, and even had the privelege of working with Foreign Militaries. I have many fond memories from the military. One being the time I came face-to-face with an alligator in Fort Polk.
    I am convinced that without the Army, I would not be who I am today. While in the Army I earned the Army Achievement Medal and Army Commendation Medal </p>
    <p><h3>NASA Programs</h3>
      I was a business major at University of Arkansas Pulaski Technical College when I received an email from my mathematics professor. It was an application for NASA Community College Aerospace Scholars (NCAS). 
      I wasn't in STEM at the time, but I had enough technology electives that I qualified.  I knew chances were slim, but I decided to risk it and see what would happen.  I would rather be rejected than ask myself "what if" every time 
      I laid my head down to sleep. I was accepted. The next five weeks consisted of tests and weekly meetings to compete for a slot at a NASA work site.  This was in conjuction with working full-time, schooling full-time, and upholding
      the standard in my military career. Needless to say I got very little sleep, but I was never going to give in or quit. I knew this was an opportunity that would happen only once in my life, so I went full throttle to the finish line.
      After many sleepless nights I turned in my final project on the exercise equipment aboard the International Space Station and space suits. A few weeks later I became one of a few hundred students invited to attend a NASA work site for
      a week. I was elated and began gearing up to head to NASA Langley Research Center. With new found confidence I eagerly applied to the Lucy Student Pipeline Accelerator and Competency Enabler Mission Concept Academy (L'SPACE MCA),
      and changed my major to Computer Science.</p>
    <div><b><em>Then the Pandemic Hit...</em></b></div>
    <p>My trip to Langley Research Center was cancelled since all NASA worksites were closed to visitors. I was gutted. I decided to keep my eyes on the finish line, and went with a positive attitude into the L'SPACE program, 
    which is named after the upcoming Lucy Mission to the Trojan Asteroids.  L'SPACE consisted of nearly nightly ZOOM meetings as I collaborated with a team of STEM students in Chicago. We used Trello, Slack, Whatsapp, and Google Suite 
    to collect and share our ideas. Because of my AS Business degree, and background in finance, I was unanimously voted in as the Lead Administrator. I was in charge of a $100 million dollar budget for Team 16's Preliminary Design Review (PDR).
    A PDR is essentially a sales pitch for a proposed NASA mission. I was able to work with the the Science and Engineer Leaders to keep spending low. We were able to come in underbudget with several million left over in margin.
    A large margin was considered great as long as we met all of our science goals, which we did. L'SPACE was a great experience and it was awesome to have virtual meetings with actual current NASA employees. </p>
